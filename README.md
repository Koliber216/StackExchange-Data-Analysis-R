# StackExchange-Data-Analysis-R
Analysis of StackExchange datasets concering users of this platform using various R libraries (base R, data.table, dplyr).
The datasets that are being analysed are in the "datasets" file, mainly: Badges, Comments, Tags, Posts, Users, Votes, PostLinks.
There is r-script for the functions and then rmd file that is the summary of the project.
I highly recommend reading the summary file first (Kubita_Mateusz_PD2) in order to get to know what is going on in this project.
This project was part of a classes about Data Exploration in R-language.
